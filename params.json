  "body": "### Abstract\r\nThis paper proposes a new framework for video semantic object segmentation. We employ a DCNN model originally trained on images rather than videos, which lack of dense annotations. However, applying the model directly on video suffers from several issues such as confusing label and label inconsistency problems. We tackles the problem by taking advantages of a video that has multiple frames, among which a few frames are helpful to improve labels of the other confusing frames. Given the semantic segmentation model and its results applied on each frame, we sample several confident frames to adapt the model to be video-specific and to focus on specific instances in the video rather than general objects in various circumstances. We propose both of offline and online approaches under different supervision levels. Our experimental results demonstrate the validity of our method by achieving great improvement compared with the original model and previous state-of-the-art methods.\r\n\r\n### Results\r\n\r\n![results](http://iip.postech.ac.kr/img/results.PNG)\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\n\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out our [documentation](https://help.github.com/pages) or [contact support](https://github.com/contact) and we’ll help you sort it out.\r\n",
